## Dataset Description
This dataset contains images of various skin infections collected from the internet. The dataset consists of **8 classes** categorized into bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral infections.

### **Classes**:
1. **Bacterial Infections**
   - Cellulitis
   - Impetigo
2. **Fungal Infections**
   - Athlete's Foot
   - Nail Fungus
   - Ringworm
3. **Parasitic Infections**
   - Cutaneous Larva Migrans
4. **Viral Infections**
   - Chickenpox
   - Shingles

## **Overview of Skin Infections**
### **Bacterial Infections**
Bacterial infections occur when bacteria enter the skin through wounds, hair follicles, or external sources. Some bacterial infections can be systemic or local, and certain types can spread through direct contact or contaminated surfaces.
- Common bacteria: **Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Anthrax, Lyme disease**
- Examples:
  - Cellulitis
  - Impetigo
  - Hansen’s disease (leprosy)
  - Syphilis

### **Fungal Infections**
Fungal infections develop in moist areas of the body like the feet, armpits, and skin folds. Some infections can cause allergic reactions that lead to symptoms elsewhere on the body.
- Examples:
  - Athlete’s foot
  - Ringworm
  - Nail fungus

### **Parasitic Infections**
Parasitic skin infections can spread beyond the skin to the bloodstream and organs. Though not life-threatening, they can cause discomfort.
- Examples:
  - Scabies
  - Cutaneous larva migrans

### **Viral Infections**
Viruses can cause systemic infections with visible skin symptoms. Most viral infections are highly contagious.
- Examples:
  - Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
  - Chickenpox

## **Model & Training**
For classification, a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model was used, achieving an incredible accuracy of **100%** on the dataset. The model effectively captures patterns and features from images, making it highly suitable for skin infection classification.

### **Results**
- **Model Used:** Vision Transformer (ViT)
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 100%

## **Acknowledgment**
This dataset was compiled for research and educational purposes in skin infection classification using deep learning models.
